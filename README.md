Generative Adversarial Networks.

I have worked on two datasets namely CIFAR10 and MNIST which can be included from torchvision like shown in https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html

Changes can be made to the code. You change the number of epochs and the hyperparameters accordingly. 

Images generated in stored in the "/results/" folder which is then compared with the real image fed in.
